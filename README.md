*LaTeX template for BigBlueButton whiteboards*

This is a LaTeX template for creating whiteboards for [BigBlueButton](https://bigbluebutton.org/) with proportions of the [default whiteboard](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/tree/develop/bigbluebutton-config/web/default.pdf).

The hope is that the BBB developers will make it possible to download the whiteboard *together with annotations* in the near future, which will make this template even more useful.
